🎓 I'm currently making waves in the field of Data Science, while earning my BS from FAST NUCES. My journey has been nothing short of an adventure, and GitHub is my logbook where you can track my progress and milestones.

🌍 My influence extends beyond my coursework. I've established FDSS, the largest Data Science community in Pakistan, where we democratize access to Data Science knowledge and foster innovation. 

📚 Not only am I a practitioner, but I'm also a contributor to academic knowledge in the field. I've published two conference papers related to AI and Data Science, spreading my insights to others and fostering discussion.

🔬 I'm always learning and currently, I'm delving deep into the mysteries of data mining and generative AI. I'm excited about the breakthroughs we're going to witness in 2023.

🏆 People call me "REVOLUTIONARY BUKHARI" because of my groundbreaking approaches and out-of-the-box thinking. My goals for 2023? Contribute more to open-source projects, produce impactful research, and bring more revolutionary ideas to life.
